### **The Business Case: Finding Hidden Costs**

In any growing company, one of the biggest hidden costs in IT is software licensing. An employee might change roles, go on leave, or leave the company, but their expensive Microsoft 365 license (like an E5, Visio, or Power BI Pro) often remains assigned and unused, quietly accumulating costs month after month.

As an IT professional, I see my role as more than just fixing problems‚Äîit's about proactively finding opportunities to make the business more efficient. Manually auditing hundreds or thousands of user accounts is incredibly time-consuming. I knew there had to be a smarter, data-driven way to handle this.

### My Approach: Turning Data into Actionable Insights

I built this tool to solve that exact problem. It's a simple yet powerful PowerShell script that connects to the company's Microsoft 365 tenant and acts as an intelligent auditor.

It doesn't just list users and licenses. It uses a **heuristic approach**, applying a simple rule: "If a user is assigned a high-cost license but hasn't logged in for more than 90 days, they are a prime candidate for a license review."

The script automatically scans all users, cross-references their assigned licenses with their last login activity, and generates a clean, simple CSV report of potential cost-saving opportunities. It turns raw data into a clear, actionable list that can be used to make smarter financial decisions.

### Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Direct Cost Savings:** Immediately identifies specific, unused licenses that can be unassigned and reallocated, leading to tangible budget savings.
*   üìä **Data-Driven Decisions:** Replaces guesswork with a clear report based on actual user activity data from Azure Active Directory.
*   üîí **Enhanced Security Posture:** By flagging inactive accounts that hold powerful licenses, it also helps reduce the company's attack surface.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Fast and Efficient:** What would take hours of manual work in the M365 Admin Center can now be done in minutes by running a single script.

This project demonstrates my ability to look beyond the immediate ticket and think strategically about how technology can serve the business's financial goals.

### **Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have the `Microsoft.Graph` PowerShell module. The script will automatically check if it's installed and will guide you if it's missing.

2.  **Permissions:** To run this script, you must sign in with a Microsoft 365 account that has at least **"Global Reader"** permissions. This is a read-only role that allows the script to see user and sign-in data without being able to change anything.

3.  **Execution:**
    *   Open a PowerShell 7 terminal and navigate to the script's folder.
    *   Run the command: `.\Run-LicenseOptimizer.ps1`
    *   A Microsoft login window will pop up. Sign in with your authorized account. You will be asked to consent to the read-only permissions the first time you run it.

4.  **The Report:** The script will display its findings directly in the console and, most importantly, will generate a `License_Optimization_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` file in the same directory for easy sharing and analysis.````

### **Part 2: The Final, Professional Code**

This script is clean, well-commented, and robust. An interviewer will see that you write code with clarity and best practices in mind.

#### **`Run-LicenseOptimizer.ps1`**

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Scans a Microsoft 365 tenant to find cost-saving opportunities by identifying
    high-cost licenses assigned to inactive users.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to Microsoft Graph to get user data. It checks users
    with specific, high-cost licenses against their last sign-in date. If a user
    has been inactive for more than a defined period (default 90 days), they are
    flagged in a final CSV report.
